# Hopin-Exam-RE
Submission for Hopin Test Engineer challenge by Rachel Egan.

Assumptions made:
- Line endings: LF
- Noted in the requirements.md that the **# of Employees** field says "if greater than 10 and less than or equal 1000" size of company should display as "Medium". I am making an assumption that this is a typo so all would done will be of the assumption that it should read as "great than 100 and less than or equal to 1000".
