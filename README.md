# Hopin-Exam-RE
Submission for Hopin Test Engineer challenge by Rachel Egan.

## How to run the project:

Clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
```

Further instructions on how to run the UI and API tests can be found in the readme files in their respective folders.

## Task 1  
The screenshot showing completion of task one is in the root of the folder as a png file named 'Hopin.Task1'.

## Task 2
The manual tests completed for task 2 is contained in a markdown file named 'task2', which has been added to the root of the repo.

## Task 3
All code for the API tests is in the folder 'api-tests' which also contains a readme file which will tell you how to run the API tests.  

## Task 4
The folder 'ui-tests' contains a readme file which will tell you how to run the UI tests either in the Cypress GUI, or in the terminal.  
All code for the UI tests is in the 'cypress' folder.  

### Assumptions made:
- Line endings: LF
- Noted in the requirements.md that the **# of Employees** field says "if greater than 10 and less than or equal 1000" size of company should display as "Medium". I am making an assumption that this is a typo so all work done will be of the assumption that it should read as "great than 100 and less than or equal to 1000".
